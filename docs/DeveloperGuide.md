## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/educonnect/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `edit i:1 s/A0123456X`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/educonnect/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/educonnect/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/educonnect/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The activity diagram below shows what happens in the `DeleteCommandParser` and `DeleteCommand` class when delete is used by the user

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteActivityDiagram.puml"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a student).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/educonnect/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Student` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/educonnect/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `educonnect.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Timetable Support

* Each `Student` object now has a `Timetable` object as an attribute.
* Each `Timetable` contains <u>5 or 7</u> `Day` objects, by default, 5 days of the week (Monday - Friday) is used.
* Each `Day` object can contain <u>0 to 24</u> 1-hour `Period` objects, or less if each `Period` has intervals longer
  than 1 hour.
* Each `Period` is defined by the start time and end time, indicated by integers on a 24-hour clock, 
  i.e. 0-23, which refers to 12 AM till 11 PM.
* Each `Day` cannot contain any overlapping `Period`.
  * An overlap occurs when the start time of the previous `Period` is before the end time of the next `Period`. 
  * E.g. for the case of `Period` of 12-14, `Period` of 14-16 is allowed, but `Period` of 13-15 is not.
* If not specified in the `add` command, or subsequently modified using the `edit` command, the `Timetable` is assumed
  to be empty, indicating no occupied period.

<puml src="diagrams/StudentClassDiagram.puml" width="450"/>

#### Listing students with timetables option

* The `Timetable` of the `Student` shown during the `list` command, followed by a `timetable` keyword.

* The `timetable` keyword is optional, and if the command is used without the `timetable` keyword, students will be shown without timetables.

* The option of displaying timetables will be saved and will remain the same for subsequent commands, unless another `list` command with different option is received.

* Each time the application is launched, the timetable will be hided in default.

* Below shows the sequence diagram when <u>listing</u> **students with timetables**.

<puml src="diagrams/ListSequenceDiagram.puml"/>

#### Adding/Editing a Student's Timetable

* The `Timetable` of the `Student` can be specified during the `add` command, indicated with a `c/` prefix.
* Similarly, the `Timetable` of a `Student` can be modified during the `edit` command, with the same prefix.
* The `c/` prefix is optional, and if not specified, 
  an empty `Timetable` object will be created as the attribute of the `Student`.
  * The arguments for the `Timetable` object can be broken down into its respective day and periods that day contains.
  * The day is indicated by its respective prefix as well, the format is `{DAY_3_LETTERS}:`, e.g. `"mon:"` or `"fri:"`.
  * The period follows this format `{HOUR-HOUR}`, in a 24-hour clock, e.g. "12-14", indicating 12 PM to 2 PM.
  * E.g. an accepted `String` is `"mon: 13-15, 15-17 tue: 12-14 thu: 12-18"`.
* Below shows the sequence diagram when <u>adding</u> a student.

<puml src="diagrams/AddSequenceDiagram.puml"/>

#### Finding Common Slots from list of Students (can be filtered)

The finding a common slot feature will have a portion implemented similarly to the `find` command. 
The command consists of a mandatory specified duration, and optional arguments for higher specificity,
and a common empty slot across all students that fulfils the duration requirement will be outputted to the user.

* The command is implemented as such: `slots d/DURATION [t/TAG] [p/TIMEFRAME_PERIOD] [o/ON_WHICH_DAYS]`
    * `d/` is the prefix for duration.
    * `t/` is an optional argument for a filtered list of students.
      * if not specified, defaults to looking through the entire list of students in EduConnect.
    * `p/` is an optional argument for specifying the timeframe to look for slots.
      * if not specified, defaults to 8 AM to 10 PM.
    * `o/` is an optional argument for on which days specifically to look for slots.
      * if not specified, defaults to Monday to Friday.
      
* Examples:
    * `slot d/1` - EduConnect will look through the current list of students, i.e. can be the full list, or a filtered
      list if ran after the `find` command, then returns all the 1-hour slot(s) available for the week.
    * `slot d/2 t/tutorial-1` - EduConnect will first filter and get the list of students with the tag `tutorial-1`, 
      then return all the 2-hour slot(s) available for the week.
    * `slot d/3 p/12-18 o/tue, wed, thu t/tutorial-2` - EduConnect will first filter and get the list of students
      with the tag `tutorial-2`, then returns all the 3-hour slot(s) available,
      between 12 PM to 6 PM, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays only.
  
* The command's execution will iterate through the selected list of students, accessing each `Timetable` object's
  list of `Day` objects.
    * Each `Day` object will look for valid `Period` that does not overlap with its own list of `Period` objects.
    * The series of valid `Period` and `Day` will be collected from each `Timetable` of each `Student`, 
      and returned as an `AvailableSlots` objects, which is collected in a `List`. 
    * Common slots across all `AvailableSlots` will then be filtered out 
      and returned as a singular `AvailableSlots` object.

* The diagram below shows the sequence diagram for an example execution of finding common slots.

<puml src="diagrams/FindingAvailableSlotsSequenceDiagram.puml"/>

_{more functionality to be implemented in later versions}_

### Website URL support

The inclusion of the `Link` attribute enhances the versatility of EduConnect, enabling storage and access to project or assignment weblinks for each student. This feature facilitates efficient collaboration and evaluation by Teaching Assistants (TAs) and provides students with a convenient means to showcase their work.
* Each `Student` has an additional attribute `Link`
* `Link` is responsible for storing the student's project or assignment weblink for ease of access by the TA.
* `Link` is wrapped around a Java `Optional` in `Student`. This means that if the link is not specified during construction of a new `Student`, the student's `Link` attribute will initialized as `Optional.empty`.
* `Link` must be a valid URL, and a validation regex is present to check the validity of the `link`.
* In scenarios involving group projects, the `Link` attribute need not be unique as group members will share the same project link. Therefore, enforcing uniqueness for the `Link` attribute could lead to unnecessary constraints and complexity.

#### Valid URLs accepted
The regex used for validating the URL is as shown below:

    ^(?<scheme>(?:ftp|https?):\/\/)?+
    (?:
        (?<username>[a-zA-Z][\w-.]{0,31})
        (?::(?<password>[!-~&&[^@$\n\r]]{6,255}))?
    @)?
    (?<subdomain>(?:[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]?\.){0,127})
    (?<domain>[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])
    (?<tld>\.[a-zA-Z]{3,63})
    (?<cctld>\.[a-zA-Z]{2})?
    (?<portnumber>:\d{1,5})?
    (?<path>(?:\/{1,2}[\w-@.~()%]*)*)
    (?<querystring>\?(?:[\w-%]+=[\w-?/:@.~!$&'()*+,;=%]+(?:&[\w-%]+=[\w-?/:@.~!$&'()*+,;=%]+)*)?)?
    (?<fragment>#[\w-?/:@.~!$&'()*+,;=%]+)?$

The capture group plan is:
| Group Number | Group name | Example |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------- |
|  1 | scheme      | `ftp://` `http://` `https://`     |
|  2 | username    | `user` `schooluser`               |
|  3 | password    | `password123` `PxJmot@S!KL1`      |
|  4 | subdomain   | `www.` `blog.` `news.`            |
|  5 | domain      | `google` `youtube` `github`       |
|  6 | tld         | `.com` `.net` `.org`              |
|  7 | cctld       | `.sg` `.jp` `.uk` `.de`           |
|  8 | port        | `:8080` `:443` `:53`              | 
|  9 | path        | `/article` `/tp/UserGuide.html`   |
| 10 | querystring | `?q=cat` `?q=pokemon+red&ie=UTF-8`|
| 11 | fragment    | `#xpointer(//Rube)` `#dfsdf`      |

#### UI implementation

* A student's weblink will be displayed using the JavaFX `Hyperlink` class at `StudentCard.java`. 
* Due to potential UI issues arising from excessively long URLs, a clickable embedded text labeled "Project Link" will be displayed instead of the actual URL.
* If the student has a valid Link, the Hyperlink will be visible and clickable, allowing users to access the weblink directly.
* If the student does not have a Link attribute or if the Link is not specified, the Hyperlink will be toggled to be invisible, ensuring a clean and uncluttered user interface.

#### Adding/Editing a student's Link

* Just like any other attribute of `Student`, `Link` can be specified during the `add` command, indicated with a `l/` prefix.
* When creating a new `Student` using the add command, the `l/` prefix is optional.
* `Link` can also be modified using the `edit` command with the `l/` prefix.
* Below shows the sequence diagram when editing a student's `Link`.

<puml src="diagrams/EditSequenceDiagram.puml"/>

### Copy Emails to Clipboard feature

Implemented similarly to the `find` command, the `copy` command first filters the `FilteredList<Student>` to display all students with the tags specified in the command.
* E.g. `copy t/tutorial-1` filters and displays all students with the exact tag `tutorial-1`.

The `FilteredList<Student>` is then iterated through, retrieving all student emails in the list and joining by `, ` delimiter (ascii hexadecimal `0x2C` comma and `0x20` space).
* Emails are concatenated in the form of `example1@email.com, example2@email.com, example3@email.com`.
* This adheres to the format specified in [section 3.4 of RFC5322](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.4), which allows for easy pasting into `Gmail`, `Outlook`, `Yahoo Mail`, etc.

#### Implementation using JavaFX Library

The feature is implemented using `javafx.scene.input.Clipboard` instead of `java.awt.datatransfer.Clipboard` as we are using JavaFX for the UI.

The fomatted email string is added to `Clipboard` as a plain text String `text/plain` (**NOT** a HTML String `text/html`).
* The diagram below shows the sequence diagram for `copy t\tutorial-1`.

<puml src="diagrams/CopySequenceDiagram.puml"/>

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete s/A1234567X` command to delete the student with that unique identifier in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the  command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new student. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the student being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix C: Effort**

#### Overview
- Our team aims at creating an application that is easy to use and helpful for TAs to manage courses. We mainly focused on features that are optimized for CLI users. 
- In addition to the existing basic features of AB3 (Address Book 3), we implement additional features including finding students, copying emails, and finding common slots for our target users - TAs.

#### Difficulty Level and Challenges Faced
- Build the application upon AB3 was a challenge for us during the starting stage of development. We took some time to get familiar with the AB3 code base, while also deciding features to adapt/remove to develop EduConnect.

- In version 1.4, the debugging stage required strategies to address several challenging issues, such as regex validation and parser support for multiple timetables. Through effective teamwork and collaborative discussions, we successfully resolved these issues.

#### Effort Required

- Efforts were allocated across various project phases, including requirement analysis, design, development, testing, deployment, and debugging. 

- We also emphasized considerable efforct on team collaboration to make the development process smooth.

#### Achievements
- Successful implementation of core functionalities, including 
finding common slots and copying student emails, which showcases our goal of creating an application with user-centric features.

- Implementation of GUI(Graphic User Interface) which aligns with the UI design as outlined in the project planning phase.

- Adherence to project timelines and deliver the milestones on time.

## **Appendix D: Planner Enhancements**

Team Size: 6
1. **Use a better font:** User experience is greatly influenced by font, and choosing the right font can significantly enhance readability, Especially for EduConnect with numeric details of students displayed, the current font causes confusion sometimes. We plan to adapt a new font which not only improve the overall appearance of the platform but also contribute to a smoother reading experience for users. Currently, we are aware that the number `1` and the letter `l` look too similar to users.

2. **Hover over â€˜Project Linkâ€™ shows the full link:** Currently, when hovering over the project link, nothing will be shown. We plan to provide users with the convenience of viewing the full link by simply hovering over it. We aim to allow users to quickly verify the complete URL without having to click on it.

3. **Show partial â€˜Project Linkâ€™ in UI:** Instead of simply a text `Project Link`, we plan to show the domain name and Top Level Domain (TLD) of the link. For example, `https://ay2324s2-cs2103-t14-1.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html` will show up as `github.io`.

4. **Better timetable display:** The current timetable of each student is displayed in text with little formatting. We plan to enhance the timetable display by incorporating a standardized graphical format, such as calendar or grid layout. This would allow users to quickly grasp their schedules at a glance and navigate through different time slots more efficiently.

5. **View student details:** The ability to view comprehensive details of each student in text, including their project link and timetable, is essential for effective management and communication within EduConnect. We plan to introduce a new "View Student" function, allowing users to access all student information conveniently.

6. **Full Name display:** If the student's name is too long, the name may be shorted and display `[partial student name]...`, leaving users unable to view the full name. We plan to limit the length of the name to 100 and ensure the minimum window size would allow the full name to be viewed at all times.

7. **Limits to Telegram Handle, Email and Tags:** There is currently no character limit for the `Telegram Handle`, `Email` and `Tag` fields. We plan to limit these fields to an appropriate character count to better represent these fields. Example:
   1. Telegram Handle maximum length is 32 characters according to [here](https://limits.tginfo.me/en).
   2. Email maximum length is 320 characters.
   3. Tag should be sufficiently long but not too long as they are used as groupings. We estimate around 40 characters to be more than sufficient.

8. **Editing Student with the same details:** Currently, when editing a student with the same details, no error message is displayed and EduConnect updates the Student with the same data. This is may confuse users and it will result in no changes while still showing a successfuull update. We plan to add a check and display the proper error message. E.g. A student with telegram handle `@bunny`, when running the command `edit h:@bunny h/@bunny` should return an error message `Duplicate telegram handle supplied.`
